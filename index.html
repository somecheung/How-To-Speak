			<p id="about" class="paragraphabout">
			  This project initially was a print publication demonstrating how to speak English with a Cantonese accent. 
			Within the print edition, &#147;rules&#148; were established to demonstrate the linguistic properties of 
			achieving a closely accurate vocal and audio quality of the accent. Though the technicality of the 
			linguistic endeavors of this project is questionable, it has provided a valuable insight into my past, and present. 
			The cultural impact of being raised Chinese-American and especially by <i>F.O.B.</i> parents and relatives. 
			<br><br>
			The digital translation of this project has taken a turn into a cultural and extremely personal 
			analysis of myself in relationship to my family, especially  with my sister. It is a record of the 
			process into the making of this project. Of interviewing my family and analyzing their inherently faulty English, 
			I have somehow come to accept the cultural embarrassment. In a way the process of interviewing my family was very much 
			stripping away my prejudice against my own identity. 
			<br><br>
			To your right, you will find the &#34; rules &#34; established by both Julia, my sister, and I. Along with rules, are audio excerpts of our interview process during the initial production of the book, <i>How to Speak English like a Cantonese</i>.
			</p>

			<p id="aboutbook" class="paragraphabout">
			This book was catalyzed during the winter of 2010, when I returned home for winter break. 
			My sister spoke frequently about her linguistic endeavors, often times probing my dad to say
			 certain words for the sake of proving what she had learned or hypothesized. As usual, I sat
			  passively, partially attentive to my dad and sister&#39;s back and forth. 
			 I finally questioned if the word <i>fried</i> was really <i>flied</i> in the minds of our 
			 immigrant relatives, knowing that the word was often used as a racial joke. Perhaps it does
			  sound more so <i>flied</i>  than <i>fried</i>. When I say <i>fried</i>, they still hear <i>flied</i>.
			  The neurological wiring of their brains has somehow transformed the <i>r</i> sound into a <i>l</i> sound.
